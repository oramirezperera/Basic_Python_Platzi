## First program a exchange calculator, from Colombian pesos to American dollars

asks the User how many Colombian pesos has, and with that the program will tell him how many American dollars has.

For this program I use the float() function to transform the input string from the user to be a float number

Then I use the print and format statement print(f'') to give format and beauty to the end of the program

Changes to the program added the :.2f to only show 2 decimals in the result
