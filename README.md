Exercises from the Basic Python Course of Platzi

## First program a exchange calculator, from Venezuelan Bolivars to American dollars

asks the User how many Dollars has, and with that the program will tell him how many Venezuelan bolivars has.

For this program I use the float() function to transform the input string from the user to be a float number

Then I use the print and format statement print(f'') to give format and beauty to the end of the program

Changes to the program added the :.2f to only show 2 decimals in the result

For educational purposes now you enter the amount of dollars you have and give you the equivalent in venezuelan bolivars at the date 8/4/2020 

## Changed this branch name
to maintain this dollars to bolivars version changed this branch name, so this version stays whithout changes
