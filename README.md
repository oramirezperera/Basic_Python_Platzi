Exercises from the Basic Python Course of Platzi

## First program an exchange calculator, from Colombian pesos to American dollars

asks the User how many Colombian pesos has, and with that the program will tell him how many American dollars has.

For this program I use the float() function to transform the input string from the user to be a float number

Then I use the print and format statement print(f'') to give format and beauty to the end of the program

Changes to the program added the :.2f to only show 2 decimals in the result

## new changes
now this program will accept Mexican and Argentinian pesos to transform to American dollars.

asks the user which they want to transform.

## Palindrome

Using the entry points, functions, conditionals, and slices. Checks out if a message or a word is a palindrome.

## Is_prime

Using the things before and the continue, break statements, I created two programs where you input a number and they return if the number is prime or not.

## Videogame

### Guess the number!
This program uses loops and a step counter so you can guess the number that the computer is thinking. 
Can you beat the marvelous computer?

## Dictionaries
created a dictionaries.py file, creating and looping through dictionaries and their, items, keys and values.
### created a new file it's a password generator
Do you need a new password?
Do you know that having the same password is very insecure?
Now with this program you don't need to think new passwords, the password comes to you as a simple string, just be careful where you store it.
